Quadproject
=====

This was done in the course Modelling and simulation project at Link√∂pings University 2015.

Cool project of a simulated quadcopter in WebGL. You can find some math in the matlab branch if you like looking at curves.

A simple multiplayer version is in the making on the game branch using websockets and a node server.
